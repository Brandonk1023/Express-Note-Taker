# <Express-Note-Taker>

## Description

This is a note taking application.  The user is able to add and remove note data from the application as the user needs.  In working on this application I was able to focus on further developing my back-end skill set, by working with Express.js, and working on developing api routes.

## Installation

For installation the user will need to run the `npm -i` command from the terminal to install the necessary dependencies to run the application.  

## Usage

Once all dependencies have been downloaded the user will need to start the server.  This can be done by using the command `node server.js` and the user will then need to go navigate to `localhost:3001` and from there they are able to use the application.

The user is presented with a start button to click.
